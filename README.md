I am a software engineer at Google Research where I head a group working working on privacy and security for ML systems. 

Before joining Google I was an associate professor in the Department of Computer Science at the Johns Hopkins University, where I headed the Hopkins InterNetworking Research (HiNRG) Group. I worked on computer networks with an emphasis on low-power and sensor networks.
