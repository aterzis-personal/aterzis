I am a software engineer at [Google Research](https://research.google/) where I head a group working working on privacy and security for ML systems. 

Before joining Google I was an associate professor in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.jhu.edu) at the [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/), where I headed the Hopkins InterNetworking Research (HiNRG) Group. I worked on computer networks with an emphasis on low-power and sensor networks.
